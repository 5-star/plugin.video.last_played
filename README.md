plugin.video.last_played
------------------------
Lists what was played most recently, allowing to resume watching directly from the addon.

Before if you wanted to finish viewing something that you had to interrupt, you had to remember it and then search, or go through a number of menus to get back to where you were.
With this addon just open it and it will display on top the last thing you watched. Click and it will resume playing directly from the addon.
